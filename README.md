# Myntra-product-scraper
Welcome to the Myntra Product Information Scraper! This Jupyter notebook, created by Prithviraj, contains a powerful Python script designed to collect detailed information about any product available on Myntra.

## How to Use:

1. **Enter Product Details:** In the input fields, provide the name of the product you're interested in and specify the number of pages to scrape.

2. **Initiate Scraping:** Click the "Scrape Data" button to initiate the web scraping process. The script will navigate through Myntra's pages, collecting brand names, model names, prices, and ratings.

3. **Data Cleaning:** The collected data is cleaned, and additional details such as discounted price, original price, discount percentage, and total reviews are extracted.

4. **Save Results:** The cleaned data is saved in an Excel file named 'myntra_cleaned_data.xlsx' for your convenience.

5. **Explore and Analyze:** Dive into the scraped data to analyze trends, make comparisons, and gather insights about your favorite products on Myntra.

Feel free to modify the script and adapt it for different products or purposes. Happy scraping! üöÄüõçÔ∏è
